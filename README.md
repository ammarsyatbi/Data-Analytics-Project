Data analytics in web application using D3 and eCharts

You will need a web server to run D3 , since I'm reading data from csv. I tried to implement whole process just by javascript including data cleaning, that's why it is kinda heavy to load.

***How to run ?***
just import to your web server and run index.html

## Library used ##

* D3
* eCharts
* jQuery
* Materialized
